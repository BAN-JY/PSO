# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
* Vehicle scheduling optimization of battery electric bus based on Partical Swarm Optimization
* There are three objectives and three constraints in this object

## main
&emsp;&emsp;Particle swarm optimization algorithm code

## Objective Function

### obj1.m
&emsp:&emsp; Objective 1: Minimize the total cost of vehicle ownership

### obj2.m
&emsp;&emsp; Objective 2: Minimize the charging fee cost

### obj3.m
&emsp;&emsp; Objective 3: Minimize the charging infrastructure cost

## Constraint

### cons1.m
&emsp;&emsp; Constraint 1: Each bus can only covers 2 times maximum trips in each day. In order to balance the usage count of each bus.

### cons2.m
&emsp;&emsp; Constraint 2: The continuous trips must be the continuation of up and down

### cons3.m
&emsp;&emsp; Constraint 3: Energy consumption constraints
