# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
Vehicle scheduling optimization of battery electric bus based on Partical Swarm Optimization

## main_function.m
&emsp;&emsp; Code of Partical Swarm Optimization Algorithm

## Objective function

### obj1.m
&emsp;&emsp; Objective 1: To minimize the total cost of vehicle ownership.

### obj2.m
&emsp;&emsp; Objective 2: To minimize the total charging fee cost.

### obj3.m
&emsp;&emsp; Objective 3: To minimize the charging infrastructure cost.

## Constraint

### cons1.m
&emsp;&emsp; Constraint 1: Each bus can only cover 2 times maximum trips in order to balance the usage count of each bus.

### cons2.m
&emsp;&emsp; Constraint 2: The continuous trip must be the up trip to down trip or down trip to up trip.

### cons3.m
&emsp;&emsp; Constraint 3: Energy consumption constraint.
